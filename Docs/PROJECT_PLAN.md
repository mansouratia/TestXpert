# 📅 Project Planning & Management

## 📌 Project Proposal

**TestXpert** is a Java-based Selenium test automation tool that enables users to define test cases using simple keywords or natural language. These steps are automatically converted into executable Selenium test code via a GUI. The application is built for QA engineers, students, and developers to simplify and speed up test creation and execution processes.
